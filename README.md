# Hacker News - Redesigned by Steve Jobs

This project is a reimagined version of Hacker News with a design inspired by Steve Jobs' minimalist aesthetic. The idea originated from a conversation with Paul Graham (YC founder) about how Steve Jobs might have approached the Hacker News design.

## The Inspiration

This repository exists because of [this conversation](https://x.com/martyamark/status/1897343263490912358) with Paul Graham:

> **Paul Graham (@paulg):**  
> People sometimes speculate about whether YC would have funded Apple. We would have if Steve Jobs wanted us to, because Steve Jobs got what he wanted.
>
> **Marty Markenson ðŸŒ´ (@martyamark):**  
> Did you have any interactions with Jobs?
>
> **Paul Graham (@paulg):**  
> I never talked to him, but I used to see him around because he lived near us.
>
> **Marty Markenson ðŸŒ´ (@martyamark):**  
> Jobs vs Hacker News design would've been an interesting discussion
>
> **Paul Graham (@paulg):**  
> I think he'd have mostly approved. It's very spare, like the output of a Unix utility.
>
> **Helghardt (@Helghardt):**  
> I agree. I think he might have even suggested ways to make it even more spare.
